## Application of Network Traffic Data

This section will talk about applications that are based on realisism instead of logic. For example, network reachability test is a logic-based application (ATPG) while network anomaly detection is a realism-based application.

measure the correctness and impact of novel algorithms

(traffic analysis => application; traffic generation => syn data fidelity)

* Sketching

* Assumption of structural property (e.g. heavy flow) of workload for time-space tradeoff

* ML/DL for fingerprinting

* ML/DL for anomaly detection

* Network Measurement

* Analysis on encrypted network traffic
